      <p class = "front-page-paragraph">Hey everyone! My name is Luke Mendiola.
        I currently live in Romeoville, IL and go to school at Lewis University. 
        My family immigrated from the Philippines to the U.S in 2004, when I was about 2 years old.
        I am currently pursuing a major Computer Science and a minor in Math.
        I changed my major 2 times previously, but I plan on sticking to Computer Science as it is something I find to be very interesting.  </p>

            People are also very welcoming there and it makes for an overall good atmosphere. Everyone is there minding their own business and at the 
            same time are willing to help you if you need.
